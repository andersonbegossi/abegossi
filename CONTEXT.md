# Context — begossi.dev portfolio

Anderson Begossi's public portfolio and technical blog. Implements, faithfully, the
"Anderson Begossi — Portfolio" design imported from claude.ai/design (source snapshot:
`docs/design/portfolio.dc.html`). The site is a professional front door for recruiters
and clients: SEO and shareable URLs are requirements, not nice-to-haves.

## Glossary

- **Screen** — one of the seven designed views: Home, About, Projects, Blog, Article,
  Resume, Contact. Each screen is a routed page (no in-memory-only screens).
- **Locale** — `en` (default, served at the URL root) or `pt` (Brazilian Portuguese,
  served under the `/pt/` prefix). Every page exists in both locales with `hreflang`
  links between the pair.
- **Post** — a blog article authored as MDX, one file per locale:
  `content/blog/<slug>/{en,pt}.mdx`. Frontmatter: `title`, `excerpt`, `date`,
  `category`, `tags`, `minutes`, `featured`.
- **Project card** — an entry on the Projects screen. Cards render a styled image
  placeholder until a real screenshot exists, and omit GitHub/Live buttons for
  repositories that are not public (see Link policy).
- **Accent** — the single brand color, red `#B91C1C` (`--accent-base`), used via the
  design's light/dark token set (`--bg`, `--fg`, `--muted`, `--faint`, `--border`,
  `--card`, `--code`).

## Fixed facts

- GitHub account for all public links: **`andersonbegossi`** (not `ambegossi`).
- LinkedIn: `linkedin.com/in/andersonbegossi-b5065a130` · Email: `andersonbegossi@gmail.com`.
- Custom domain: to be purchased (begossi.dev has no DNS today). Until then the site
  lives on its Vercel URL; the canonical base URL is a single site-config constant.
- Assets pulled from the design project live in `assets/` until the app scaffold
  exists, then move to `public/`: `hero-photo.webp`, `Anderson-Begossi-Resume.pdf`.

## Link policy

A visible link must resolve. Project GitHub/Live buttons are omitted while the target
repo is private/nonexistent (`stewart-acid-base`, `voce-mais-saude`,
`rn-monorepo-starter` all 404 publicly today). Exception: the `begossi.dev` project
card links to this repository (`github.com/andersonbegossi/abegossi`), which is public.
The design's placeholder `apps.apple.com` "Live" link is dropped.

## Decisions

See `docs/adr/`:

- 0001 — Next.js with full static generation
- 0002 — i18n URL structure: EN at root, `/pt/` prefix
- 0003 — Blog content as MDX, one file per post per locale
- 0004 — Contact form delivers via Formspree
- 0005 — Hosting on Vercel
